## 🏥 Medical Information

### Tumor Types Classification

#### 🧠 **Glioma**
- Most common primary brain tumor originating from glial cells
- Can be low-grade (slow-growing) or high-grade (aggressive)
- Symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive changes
- Treatment: Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy

#### 🧠 **Meningioma**
- Usually benign tumor arising from meninges (brain covering)
- Slow-growing and often curable with surgery
- Symptoms: Headaches, vision problems, weakness
- Treatment: Surgical removal, radiation therapy

#### 🧠 **Pituitary Tumor**
- Tumor of the pituitary gland affecting hormone production
- Can be functioning (hormone-producing) or non-functioning
- Symptoms: Hormonal imbalances, vision changes, headaches
- Treatment: Surgery, medication, radiation

#### ✅ **No Tumor**
- Normal brain tissue without pathological findings
- Healthy brain MRI scan
- No immediate medical intervention required
- Regular monitoring recommended if symptoms persist
