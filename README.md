- Symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive changes
- Treatment: Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy

#### 🧠 **Meningioma**
- Usually benign tumor arising from meninges (brain covering)
- Slow-growing and often curable with surgery
- Symptoms: Headaches, vision problems, weakness
- Treatment: Surgical removal, radiation therapy

#### 🧠 **Pituitary Tumor**
